### CardData.gd
`class_name CardData`, extends `Resource`.

One row from the `cards` SQLite table, plus a few runtime fields:
- `card_name: String`
- `cost: int` — 작전 점수 cost
- `uses: int` — max plays per match (0 = unlimited)
- `cast_method: String` — `range / target / location / instant`
- `target: String` — `caster / enemy / ally / pilot / hand / location`
- `cast_range: int` — tiles from caster (0 = self, 99 = unbounded)
- `area: int` — AoE radius around target (0 = single)
- `keyword: String` — empty or `"exhaust"` (소멸)
- `effect: String` — semicolon-chain dispatched by `CardPhaseManager`
  (e.g. `"draw:2;discard:2"`, `"attack:1|pierce"`)
- `description: String` — text shown on the card front + description box
- `scope: String` — `any` / `lane` / `jungle` (`SCOPE_*` consts). 시전자 제약;
  read once, at deal time, by `CardPhaseManager._pool_for_pilot` via
  `allowed_for_guerrilla(is_guerrilla)`. `lane` cards never reach a 정글러 and
  `jungle` cards never reach a 레인 파일럿. Unknown values = unrestricted.
- `pool: int` — `1` = in the random starter-deck pool, `0` = excluded (결투).
- `owner_pilot: PilotData` (runtime, **not** `@export`) — the 시전자, set
  by `CardPhaseManager.build_starter_decks()`
- `remaining_uses: int` (runtime) — per-instance charges left this match

Instantiated at runtime by `CardPhaseManager.build_starter_decks()` from the
`cards` SQLite table (loaded into `GameManager.card_pool_bs`). Not saved to disk.

### GameEnums.gd
`class_name GameEnums`, extends `RefCounted`.

Shared enum definitions:
- `Role { TANK, FIGHTER, ASSASSIN, SUPPORT, SNIPER }` — pilot/player position
- `LanePosition { LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT, GUERRILLA }` — battle-lane slot
- `Lane { LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT }` — waypoint/building lanes (no GUERRILLA)
- `BattlePhase { GAMBIT, CARD_PHASE, BATTLE }` — in-battle phase machine
- `TowerLevel { HQ, LEVEL_2, LEVEL_1 }` — building atlas selector
- `MatchPhase { LOAD, BAN_PICK, ASSIGN, JUNGLE_START, LAUNCH }` — out-of-battle pipeline
- `JungleStartDir { LEFT, RIGHT }` — assassin's jungle entry side
- `DraftSide { BLUE, RED }` — ban/pick draft sides

### PilotData.gd
`class_name PilotData`, extends `RefCounted`.

In-battle pilot state: role, hp/max_hp, atk, team, grid_pos, lane, waypoint_idx,
`move_range` (cells per minute), `jungle_start_pref` (GameEnums.JungleStartDir
or -1), plus combat dice stats `hit` and `evasion` populated from PlayerData
(`mechanics` → hit, `gamesense` → evasion).

`presence` and `speed` are copied from the assigned mech and are **read only by
the 교전 무대** (`RealtimeEngageSim`) — presence as target aggro weight, speed as
the ATB fill rate. The turn-based battlefield ignores both. Fallbacks when no
mech is assigned (standalone battle): presence 4 / 2 and speed 78 / 82 by
melee / ranged.

`respawn_timer: int` is the off-field clock and **death is the only thing that
puts a pilot off the field**. It counts down from `BattleSim.respawn_turns_now()`
in `SimulationCore.process_respawns` while `alive = false`. **Never read it
directly to show "turns left"** — call `BattleSim.turns_until_return(p)`, which
also floors the answer at 1 for a downed pilot so a card doesn't flicker
unlocked on the tick before the return.

`recall_hold: bool` is the 본진 복귀 cost. A recall (`RecallSystem.return_to_hq`)
lands the pilot in its HQ at full HP **without touching `alive`** — it is in
play the whole time — and sets this flag; `SimulationCore.resolve_movement`
spends it to skip the pilot for exactly one movement pass, so the lane walk
restarts from waypoint 0 the next turn. Nothing else reads it. (The former
model — off the field, healing `RECALL_HEAL_RATIO` per turn until full — and its
`is_recalling` flag are both gone.)

`jungle_roam_target: Vector2i` ((-1,-1) = none) is the jungler's sticky roam
destination, held across turns by `SimulationCore._jungle_goal_for` so the
target cannot flip mid-route and bounce the jungler between two cells. Only
that function writes it; nothing else on `PilotData` reads it.

`shield: int` is the 보호막 pool granted by the 보호 card. Both card attacks
and battlefield damage (the `damage_map` apply step in `SimulationCore.simulate_turn`)
subtract from `shield` first, then `hp`. Cleared on every 본진 복귀 path:
`RecallSystem.return_to_hq` (저HP / 위치 이탈 복귀),
`CardPhaseManager._effect_recall_ally` (복귀 card),
`SimulationCore.process_respawns` (부활) and
`BattleSim.mark_pilot_dead` (death).
`BattleRenderer._draw_pilot_circle` paints a cyan ring just outside the HP ring
sized by `shield / max_hp` so the buff is visible on the field.

UI animation fields (`anim_prev_grid_pos`, `anim_move_t/dur`, `anim_shake_t/dur`,
`anim_recall_phase/t/dur/orig`, `anim_death_phase/t/dur/cell`) are mutated by
`BattleSim.anim_pilot_*` helpers and read only by `BattleRenderer` — the
simulation never reads them. The recall sequence always plays both halves
(fade-out at the old cell → fade-in at HQ), since a 복귀 never removes the pilot
from the field; the `anim_death_*` group is what keeps a killed pilot on screen
(dimmed, then fading upward) after `alive` has already flipped to false.

### TurretData.gd
In-battle turret state — see `features/battle_sim/README.md`.

`anim_hit_t` / `anim_hit_dur` are the 피격 연출 timer, set by
`BattleSim.anim_turret_hit` and consumed by `BattleSim._advance_turret_animations`.
Like the `PilotData.anim_*` group the simulation never reads them, but the
consumer differs: the shake/flash is written onto the turret's `Building` node
(BattleSim owns that), and only the HP-bar offset goes through `BattleRenderer`
via `BattleSim.turret_hit_offset(td)`.

### PlayerData.gd
`class_name PlayerData`, extends `Resource`.

Out-game player persona consumed by MatchFlow / BattleSim:
- `id, name, role (GameEnums.Role), team_id (0=player, 1=enemy)`
- Stats `laning, mechanics, gamesense, teamfight, mental` (each 1–100)
- `assigned_mech: MechData` — set by AssignController at match prep time

Loaded from the `players` table (CSV-seeded via `addons/csv_to_db`).

### MechData.gd
`class_name MechData`, extends `Resource`.

Mech with **no role/position** — any mech is assignable to any player slot:
- `id, name`
- Combat stats `hp, atk` — drive PilotData stats when piloted
- `presence` (4 = melee / 2 = ranged) — **교전 무대 전용**. 타겟 어그로 가중치
  (높을수록 자주 표적이 된다)
- `speed` (40~100) — **교전 무대 전용**. ATB 게이지 충전 속도. 높을수록 자기
  차례가 자주 돌아오고, 느린 메크가 한 번 행동할 때 두 번 행동하기도 한다.
  전장(턴제)은 이 값을 읽지 않는다 — 전장 이동은 `PilotData.move_range` 소관.
  `mechs.csv` 에서는 hp 와 역상관으로 채워져 있다(무거운 탱커가 느리다).

Loaded from the `mechs` table.

### BuildingData.gd / WaypointData.gd
Optional inspector-set blueprint resources for `Building` / `Waypoint` nodes
under `BattleField/BuildingLayer` and `BattleField/WaypointLayer`.

### UiHelpers.gd
`class_name UiHelpers`, extends `RefCounted`. Static helpers for
procedurally-built UI panels — currently `mk_label(...)` shared by MatchFlow
controllers and HudBuilder.

## Usage Pattern
```gdscript
# Reference enums
GameEnums.MatchPhase.BAN_PICK

# Create card data
var card = CardData.new("Strike", 1, "A basic attack.")

# Match-flow data
var p := PlayerData.new(0, "Faker", GameEnums.Role.ASSASSIN, 0, 95, 95, 98, 95, 98)
var m := MechData.new(12, "Phantom-S1", 90, 26, 0, 2)
p.assigned_mech = m
```
